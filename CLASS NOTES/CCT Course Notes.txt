Information Security Threats and Vulnerabilities


Threat
undesirable event that can eventually damage and disrupt the operational and functional activities of an organization.
Attackers use cyber attacks to infiltrate and steal data such as individual's personal information, financial information, and login credentials.

	Examples of Threats:
 An attacker stealing sensitive data of an organization 
 An attacker causing a server to shut down 
 An attacker tricking an employee into revealing sensitive information 
 An attacker infecting a system with malware 
 An attacker spoofing the identity of an authorized person to gain access 
 An attacker modifying or tampering with the data transferred over a network 
 An attacker remotely altering the data in a database server 
 An attacker performing URL redirection or URL forwarding
 An attacker performing privilege escalation for unauthorized access 
 An attacker executing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks for making resources unavailable 
 An attacker eavesdropping on a communication channel without authorized access

Introduction to Malware
malicious software that damages or disables computer systems and gives limited or full control
Different Ways for Malware to Enter a System
Instant Messenger Applications
Portable Hardware Media/Removable Devices
Browser and Email Software Bugs
Insecure Patch Management
Rogue/Decoy Applications
Untrusted Sites and Freeware Web Applications/Software
Email Attachments
Network Propagation
File Sharing Services
Installation by other Malware
Bluetooth and Wireless Networks

Common techniques attacks use to distribute malware on the web
black hat search engine optimization
social engineered click-jacking
spear-phishing sites
malvertising
compromised legitimate websites
drive-by downloads
spam emails

Components of Malware
Crypter - conceal
Downloader - downloads the code
Dropper - covert carrier, transports
Exploit - sequence of commands
Injector - injects exploits or malicious codes
Obfuscator - conceals the code in more complex and difficult way
Packer - compresses the file
Payload - performs any desired activity
Malicious Code - heart of the malware
	Java Applets
	ActiveX Controls
	Browser Plug-ins
	Pushed Content

Types of Malware
trojans -harmful code contained inside a harmless program

indications>

computer screen blinks, display backwards
default background, change automatically
web page suddenly opens
color settings changes
antivirus automatically disabled
pop-up suddenly appears
windows start button gone
clipboard appear to be manipulated
keyboard and mouse freeze
contacts receive emails that user did not send
strange personal message asking to answer
system turns off and restarts in unusual ways
task disappears automatically
task manager disabled


how hackers use trojans>

delete os's critical files
generate fake traffic
records screenshots
download malicious files
disable firewalls
create backdoors
infect as a proxy server for relaying attacks
use victim pc as a botnet to perform ddos attacks
steal information
encrypt the machine to avoid from victim accessing it
to store illegal materials
ftp server for pirated software
script kiddies just want to have fun
to make the target be held responsible

types of trojans>

	remote access trojans (RATs) - can give full control, acts as a server and listens on a port
	backdoor trojans - bypass stand system authentication like IDS and firewalls
	botnet trojans - "bot herders" infect larger number of computers (SEO hacking, phishing, etc.)
	rootkit trojans - cannot be detected, gives full control
	e-banking trojans - steal minimum or max monetary amounts in online banking
	point-of-sale trojans - grabs credit card's info
	defacement trojans - can destroy or change the entire content of a database
	service protocol trojans - take advantage of vulnerable service protocols
	mobile trojans - targets mobile phones
	iot trojans - puts botnet to attack other machines outside the iot network
	security software disabler trojans - stops firewalls and IDS by killing the process (entry trojans)
	destructive trojans - OS failure, random deletion (antivirus may not detect it)
	ddos attack trojans - performs ddos attacks
	command shell trojans - trojan server installs on machine, provides control of a command shell
	

viruses - scourge of modern computing. self-replicating program, has variety of files, can be spread from one PC to another

characteristics>

infect other programs
transform themselves
encrypt themselves
alter data
corrupt files and programs
self-replicate

motives for virus>

inflict damage
realize financial benfs.
vandalize
play pranks
conduct research
engage in cyber-terror
distru. polit. messages
damage networks
gain remote access

indications>

degraded performance
no display
OS does not load
computer freezes
folders are missing
suspicious hard drive activity
browser freezes
lack of storage space
unwanted ads and pop-up
unable to open files
strange emails

lifecycle>

design - development of virus code
replication - spreads itself
launch - activated performs specific actions
detection - identified as a threat
incorporation - assimilates defenses
execution of the damage routine - install antivirus and eliminate the virus

how does computer get infected by it>

downloads
email attachments
pirated software
failing to install security software
updating software
browsers
firewalls
pop-ups
removable media
network access
backup and restore
malicious online ads
social media

types of viruses>

	system/boot sector virus - common one, master boot record (MBR) is where it copies itself
	file virus - 
	multipartite virus
	macrovirus
	cluster virus
	stealth/tunneling virus
	encryption virus
