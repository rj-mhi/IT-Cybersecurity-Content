# List all files in a folder
Get-ChildItem C:\Users\YourName\Documents

# Copy files from one folder to another
Copy-Item "C:\Source\file.txt" "C:\Destination\"

# Create a new folder
New-Item -Path "C:\TestFolder" -ItemType Directory


# Get all stopped services
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Stopped"}

# Start a service
Start-Service -Name "Spooler"

# Stop a service
Stop-Service -Name "Spooler"


# List all running processes, sort by memory usage, and show top 5
Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property WorkingSet -Descending | Select-Object -First 5



Working with text files
--------------------------
# Read a file
Get-Content C:\TestFolder\data.txt

# Write to a file
"Hello PowerShell" | Out-File C:\TestFolder\output.txt

"Additional text" | Add-Content C:\TestFolder\output.txt




Automate Tasks Examples
------------------------------------
Automate Report Generation

# Export a list of running processes to CSV
Get-Process | Select-Object Name, CPU, Id | Export-Csv "C:\Processes_$(Get-Date -Format yyyyMMdd).csv" -NoTypeInformation
Write-Output "Process report generated."


Automate Script Example

Create PowerShell script that will:

	Prompt the user to save their work
	Rename the computer
	Restart the computer


	# Prompt the user to save their work
	$save = Read-Host "Please save all your work. Press Enter when ready to continue."

	# Ask for the new computer name
	$newName = Read-Host "Enter the new computer name"

	# Rename the computer

	# Confirm and restart
	Write-Output "The computer will now restart to apply the new name."
