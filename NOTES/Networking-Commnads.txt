Network Commands and Utilities — Definitions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. traceroute

A tool that shows the path your network traffic takes from your device to a destination. It lists all routers (“hops”) along the way and helps identify delays or connection issues.

2. ipconfig, ifconfig, and ip addr

ipconfig (Windows): Displays IP address, subnet mask, and gateway information for your device.

ifconfig (Linux/macOS – older tool): Shows and configures network interface settings such as IP address and status.

ip (Linux – modern tool): Replaces ifconfig and provides advanced control of routing, interfaces, IP addresses, and network settings.

3. the ifconfig Utility

An older Linux command used to view or change network interface settings, assign IP addresses, enable/disable interfaces, and check MAC addresses.

4. the ip Utility

A modern networking tool in Linux used to manage IP addresses, routing tables, interfaces, and tunnels. It provides more features and accuracy than ifconfig.

5. the iptables Utility

A Linux firewall tool that allows administrators to control inbound and outbound traffic. It filters packets, blocks unwanted connections, and applies security rules.

6. the ping Utility

A basic tool used to check if another device on the network is reachable. It sends small packets and measures how long they take to return, helping test connectivity and delay.

Network Protocols and Supporting Tools
7. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

A protocol that maps IP addresses to physical MAC addresses on a local network. It allows devices to locate each other at the hardware level.

8. the arp Utility

A command that displays or manages the ARP table, showing which IP addresses correspond to which MAC addresses.

9. the nslookup Utility

A DNS query tool used to find domain name information, such as converting a website name into its IP address. Useful for troubleshooting DNS issues.

10. Resolving Names with the Hosts file

A local system file that manually maps domain names to IP addresses. It overrides DNS and is often used for testing or blocking certain sites.

Diagnostic and Security Tools
11. the mtr Command (pathping)

A combined network tool that performs both ping and traceroute. It shows real-time network performance across each hop to the destination.

12. the Nmap Utility

A powerful network scanning tool used to discover devices, open ports, services, and security vulnerabilities on a network.

13. the route Command

Displays or modifies the system’s routing table. It shows how a device decides where to send outbound network traffic.

14. the netstat Utility

Shows active network connections, open ports, routing tables, and protocol statistics. Useful for monitoring network activity and troubleshooting.

15. tcpdump

A packet capture tool that records and displays network traffic in real time. It helps diagnose complex issues by showing raw data packets.
