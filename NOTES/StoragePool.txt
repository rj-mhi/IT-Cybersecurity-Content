Storage Specs in Windows 11
-----------------------------------------------------
Storage specs typically include details about your system’s storage hardware and configuration:
Drive type: HDD (Hard Disk Drive) or SSD (Solid State Drive)
Capacity: Total and available space on each drive
File system: Usually NTFS or exFAT
Partition layout: How your disk is divided (e.g., C: for OS, D: for data)
Performance metrics: Read/write speeds, health status, and optimization settings
Interface: SATA, NVMe, USB, etc.


You can view these specs via:
	Settings > System > Storage
	Task Manager > Performance tab
	Disk Management (diskmgmt.msc)
	Command Prompt (wmic diskdrive get or Get-PhysicalDisk in PowerShell)

🧩 Storage Pools and Storage Spaces
	Windows 11 includes Storage Spaces, a feature that lets you group multiple physical drives into a storage pool and create virtual drives (called storage spaces) from that pool.

	🔹 Key Concepts:
	Storage Pool: A collection of physical drives (internal or external) combined into one logical unit.
	Storage Space: A virtual drive created from the pool, which appears like a regular drive in File Explorer.

🔹 Benefits:
	Data protection: Use mirroring or parity to guard against drive failure.
	Scalability: Add more drives to expand storage without reconfiguring.
	Flexibility: Mix different drive types (USB, SATA, SAS).

🔹 Storage Space Types:
	Type		Drives Needed	Protection Level
	Simple		1+		No protection
	Two-way mirror	2+		Protects against 1 failure
	Three-way mirror	5+		Protects against 2 failures
	Parity		3+		Efficient storage with fault tolerance



File History
------------------
File History in Windows 11 is a built-in backup feature that automatically saves copies of your personal files — such as documents, pictures, music, videos, and desktop files — so you can restore them later if they’re lost, damaged, or deleted.

	Control Panel --> File History
	
	Restore previos versions of same file.
