STP
Spanning Tree Protocol
is a network protocol used to prevent loops in Ethernet networks by creating a loop-free logical topology.

 
CMSA/CD
Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection
It used for detecting collisions on a network
It is device-dependent as it needs to be enabled on the device, When a device has the CSMA/CD capability, it first listens to the traffic and then transmits it. If there is a collision taking place, the device stops transmitting data.

ARP
Address Resolution Protocol
Resolves the IP Address to MAC Address.
is a network protocol used to map an Internet Protocol (IP) address to a physical machine address, known as a Media Access Control (MAC) address. It enables devices on a local network to communicate by resolving IP addresses to their corresponding MAC addresses, facilitating data transmission.

Neighbor Discovery Protocol
It used by IPv6 to determine the neighbors
Works on the Link layer of the Internet network architecture
