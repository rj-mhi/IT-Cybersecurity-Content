**Ethernet Switching Features**



**Network Fundamentals**



**Types of VLANs**



**Data Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)**

* is a network that groups a set of system with a virtual network.
* is a way to create separate networks within a single physical network, allowing devices to communicate as if they were different networks even if they share the same hardware.



**Voice VLANs**

* are dedicated network segments designed to prioritize voice over IP (VoIP) traffic, ensuring high-quality communication by minimizing latency and jitter.



**Port Configuration - Port Aggregation**

* a method of combing two or more ports.



**Port Mirroring**

* is a method of a method of sending received traffic on a switch to the connected device



**Port Security**

* a network security feature commonly used in Ethernet switches to control access to the network and protect against unauthorized devices.
* 
**&nbsp;	- MAC Address Limiting**

		**-** Administrators can configure the switch to allow only a specified number of MAC addresses on a port.



**Jumbo Frames**

* Has a payload larger than the standard size, which is 1500 bytes
* Can be 9000 bytes.



**PABX(Private Automatic Branch Exchange)**

* A telephone system is a private network used within a business that allows for internal communication and connects to external phone lines automatically, without the need for manual operators.



**Switch CLI Commands**

* **Similar to Router CLI**
* 
**&nbsp;	- SHOW IP INT BR**

		**-** Shows the summary of what is connected.
